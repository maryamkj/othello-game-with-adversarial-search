# Othello Game Playing with min-max algorithm

This project implements an AI agent that can play Othello. The algorithm takes advantage of alpha-beta pruning and has a heuristic evaluation function to implement Cutting-off Search. Two agents currently play against eachother but the project can easily be modified so an agent can against a human.
